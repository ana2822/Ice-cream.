<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line-height:30px;">Ice cream parlors (American English) or ice cream parlours (British English) are places that sell ice cream, gelato, sorbet, and/or frozen yogurt to consumers.<br> Ice cream is typically sold as regular ice cream (also called hard-packed or hard-serve ice cream), and/or soft serve, which is usually dispensed by a machine with a limited number of flavors (e.g., chocolate, vanilla, and "twist", or "zebra", a mix of the two).<br> Ice cream parlors generally offer a number of flavors and items.<br> Parlors often serve ice cream and other frozen desserts in cones, cups or dishes, the latter two to be eaten with a spoon.<br> Some ice cream parlors prepare ice cream desserts such as sundaes (ice cream topped with syrup, whipped cream and other toppings) or milkshakes, or even a blend (known as a Boston shake).</p>

<h3 style="font-size:50px; text-align:center":>Where do Ice creams and Ice cream parlours originate from?</h3>
<hr>

<p style="font-size:20px; text-align:center; line height:30px;">In the early 1800s, an early form of a U.S. ice cream parlor was existent in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania that sold "all kinds of refreshments, as Ice Cream, Syrups, French Cordials, Cakes, Clarets of the best kind, Jellies, etc.<br> According to one source, the first U.S. ice cream parlor opened in New York City in 1790.<br>The first ice cream factory was built by Jacob Fussell, a milk dealer who bought dairy products from Philadelphia farmers and sold them in Baltimore.<br> The mass production of ice cream cut the product's cost significantly, making it more popular and more affordable for people of lower classes.<br.In 1686, Francesco Procopio del Coltelli opened Paris' first café.<br> The Café Procope, named by its Sicilian founder, introduced gelato to the French public.<br> The dessert was served to its elite guests in small porcelain bowls.</p>
